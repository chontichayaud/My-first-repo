    <h2>Motherhood climber</h2>
    <p>
      Climbing is a hobby that my partner and I enjoy. we have been climbing for years before I got pregnant. Now, I am a mum of 1 year old boy.
      After give birth with c-section. I started to climb when my baby was 2 month, most of sites recommemed it's best to wait untill you had 6-8 weeks postnatal check before returning to your pre-pregnancy levels of exercise. 
      If you had your baby today, you could start climbing again as soon as <span id="dateIn6Weeks"></span> , if you felt ready.
